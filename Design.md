## Q/A
How should a user make a portal, and how should that portal be linked to any
existing portal tree?
    For now portal constructions/casting should be the same as building a
    Nether portal. Maybe make it out of simple items, like stone, and hit
    the portal with a weird object or something (flint and steel) to
    activate.
    In a future version of this mod, it would be nice if users could just open
    portals to anywhere on the map, maybe under some conditions or at a cost.

Should portals be bi-directional?
    Yes, always while they exist.

Should portals be temporary?
    Not yet.

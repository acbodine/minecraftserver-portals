![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/acbodine/minecraftserver-portals.svg?branch=master)

This Minecraft mod adds features that enable users to construct a dynamic
network of portals to transport a user's character to the next portal in the
portal chain, wherever that may be.

## How to I open an portal?

All portal documentation for users is maintained in this repo's
[Wiki](https://github.com/acbodine/minecraftserver-portals/wiki) Please refer
there for all you need to know about setting up and using this mod.
